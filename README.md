# pitch-perfect
This was my first iOS project and was done during the course "Intro to iOS App Development with Swift" (Udacity). The main goal of this project was to provide a solid foundation in iOS development.

The application allows the user to record audio using the deviceâ€™s built-in microphone and then uses this recorded audio file to add six different effects to it. 

Written in Swift, this application leverages the power of UIKit and AVFoundation.

Covered in this project:
- View Controllers and multiple views (UINavigationController and Segues)
- Autolayout and buttons (including StackViews)
- Audio processing with AVFoundation (Playback and Effects).

Besides the course requirements it was done:
- Ask for user's permission to use microphone
- Send alerts to the user.
- Use of extensions.
