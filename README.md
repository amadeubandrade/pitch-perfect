# pitch-perfect
This application allows the user to record audio using the deviceâ€™s built-in microphone and then uses this recorded audio file to add six different effects to it. 
Written in Swift, this application leverages the power of UIKit and AVFoundation.

Covered in this project:
- View Controllers and multiple views (UINavigationController and Segues)
- Autolayout and buttons (including StackViews)
- Audio processing with AVFoundation (Playback and Effects)
